Scala Tabular Transformer
=========================

This transforms tabular data files into Iterators of Lists of Strings, making annoying files like XLS and XLSX process-able in a more Scala-ish way.

This code could be improved in its management of resources, but it works well.

I pulled this from a larger project of mine that has extensive tests using files taken from the wild; unfortunately, the files do not come with permission from their owners to distribute, so tests here are initially minimal.
